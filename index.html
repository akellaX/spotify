Tegan and Sara began playing guitar and writing songs at age 15,[6] forming a band called Plunk without a drummer or bass player. In 1997, they used their school's recording studio to record two demo albums: Who's in Your Band? and Play Day. In 1998, they won Calgary's "Garage Warz" competition, using the studio time they won to record their first professional demo, Yellow tape, which was followed by Orange tape and Red tape.

In 1999, they released their debut album Under Feet Like Ours independently under the name "Sara and Tegan" with producer Jared Kuemper.[9] Two songs from Red tape appeared on the album, and two from Orange tape. They later changed their name to "Tegan and Sara" because people thought they were a solo act named "Sara Antegan." The new name was more memorable and their first album was later reprinted under the name Tegan and Sara. In 1999 they signed with Neil Young's Vapor Records and released This Business of Art through the label in 2000. They have toured extensively since then. In 2002, the band released their third album If It Was You. Their fourth album, So Jealous, was released in 2004 and led to wider success and attention, both locally and internationally. This album was released through both Vapor and Sanctuary. One track of the album, "Walking with a Ghost",[10] was covered by The White Stripes, who released it on their Walking with a Ghost EP.[11]
